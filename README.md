# SpinFun – Interactive Activity Selection App

**Lab Evaluation Documentation**

## Project Overview

**SpinFun** is a React-based web application designed to help **autistic children** choose indoor activities in a fun, structured, and sensory-friendly way.
The core idea is to reduce **decision fatigue** by using an **interactive spinning wheel** that randomly suggests activities, making the process engaging and stress-free.

The application is built as a **Single Page Application (SPA)** using **React Router**, ensuring smooth navigation without page reloads.

## About the Use Case

Children on the autism spectrum often benefit from **visual cues**, **structured choices**, and **minimal cognitive load**. Choosing activities can sometimes become overwhelming.

SpinFun acts as a **digital activity assistant** by:

* Offering visual activity suggestions
* Providing a predictable and simple interface
* Encouraging creativity and emotional regulation
* Reducing anxiety caused by too many choices

The Documentation page itself serves as a **self-explaining lab evaluation page**, describing features, concepts used, and future scope.
