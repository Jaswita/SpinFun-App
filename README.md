SpinFun is a React-based web application created to support autistic children by offering a simple and fun way to choose indoor activities through a spinning wheel interface. The aim is to reduce decision fatigue and provide quick, sensory-friendly activity suggestions that help regulate emotions, encourage creativity, and break routine boredom. The application is visually engaging, accessible, and designed with care to suit the needs of neurodivergent children.

Targeted Users- SpinFun is primarily targeted at children on the autism spectrum, especially those in the early learning stages who benefit from visual cues, structured activities, and minimal cognitive overload. The app is designed for children who may struggle with traditional decision-making or who respond better to visual-spatial input. It also supports parents, educators, and therapists working with autistic children.
